Arka's repo is the final version of the project.

Field.c
Negotiation.c
MessageTest.c
AgentTest.c

The battleboats system works using four main files. The agent, negotiation, message, and field
modules. The agent module is the state machine which switches from the different states in the
game. The field was used to diplay both fields in battle ship. The message module was used to 
securely and properly communicate with the two boards. The negotiation module was used to
decide the first player to play.

Every one of the modules worked well for us. The game functions well, and we tested all of the
different edge cases using the autograder results and the .o files that were provided. The .o
files became very useful as we were able to run our test harness on that code and check it
against our own. I learnt how to incorporate different modules to create a new whole lab. It
also taught me how important communication is. The only thing I'd change in this lab is the
organization of the lab manual. It could've been better organized. Also my git never worked till
Sunday, so I could only push after that day, even though I had put in work throuhgout the week.

I would like add on a few more comments. First and foremost thanks to Max and all of the TAs for
graciously helping us out through such a tough time. I myself was going through an incredibly
hard time as I had to live with my grandmother 300 miles from home and take care of her while
taking a full university courseload. My grades aren't horrendous, but I'm hoping that a decent
curve will help the many students who are struggling in this class, while managing other 
responsibilities. I've heard that many students have scored higher than the quarters before, but
I hope the curve is still generous for students who truly had to juggle many things during this
quarter. Thank you and hope you have a great summer!
