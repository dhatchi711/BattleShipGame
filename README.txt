The battleboats system works using four main files. The agent, negotiation, message, and field
modules. The agent module is the state machine which switches from the different states in the
game. The field was used to diplay both fields in battle ship. The message module was used to 
securely and properly communicate with the two boards. The negotiation module was used to
decide the first player to play.

Every one of the modules worked well for us. The game functions well, and we tested all of the
different edge cases using the autograder results and the .o files that were provided. The .o
files became very useful as we were able to run our test harness on that code and check it
against our own. I learnt how to incorporate different modules to create a new whole lab. It
also taught me how important communication is.
